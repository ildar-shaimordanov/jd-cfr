# CFR (Class File Reader) - Another Java Decompiler
# https://github.com/leibnitz27/cfr
#
# It's implemented entirely in Java 6 and able to decompile modern Java
# features - including much of Java 9, 12, and 14.
#
# This file is wrapper for CFR to simplify its invocation.
# It looks for the latest Jar file in the same directory.
