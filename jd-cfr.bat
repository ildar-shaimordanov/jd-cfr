:: CFR (Class File Reader) - Another Java Decompiler
:: https://github.com/leibnitz27/cfr
::
:: It's implemented entirely in Java 6 and able to decompile modern Java
:: features - including much of Java 9, 12, and 14.
::
:: This file is wrapper for CFR to simplify its invocation.
:: It looks for the latest Jar file in the same directory.
